To install the needed libraries for the rss scripts, do the following in the project's rss directory:

- pip install virtualenv
- virtualenv venv
- source venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt

note - each time you open a new terminal and want to run the rss scripts you will need to do "source venv/bin/active".

If you don't want to mess with the virtual environment, just do "pip install -r requirements.txt"
