Our project will be a website that displays geographically relevant real­time news. Upon opening the website the user will see a map of the United States. Each individual state will be selectable as the user’s mouse moves across the map. Once a state is clicked it will show the local real­time news headlines. The user can then click on the headlines to further investigate the story at their respective news sources. The purpose of the project is to generate a way for people to get news based on their interest in location instead of receiving news based on popularity.
